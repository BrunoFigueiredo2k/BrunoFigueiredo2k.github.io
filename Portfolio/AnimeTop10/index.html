                        Gol D. Roger was known as the "Pirate King," the strongest and most infamous being to have
                        sailed the Grand Line. The capture and execution of Roger by the World Government brought a
                        change throughout the world. His last words before his death revealed the existence of the
                        greatest treasure in the world, One Piece. It was this revelation that brought about the Grand
                        Age of Pirates, men who dreamed of finding One Piece—which promises an unlimited amount of
                        riches and fame—and quite possibly the pinnacle of glory and the title of the Pirate King.
                        Following in the footsteps of his childhood hero, Luffy and his crew travel across the Grand
                        Line, experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling dark mysteries and battling strong enemies, all
                        in order to reach the most coveted of all fortunes—One Piece.

                        Hunter x Hunter is set in a world where Hunters exist to perform all manner of dangerous tasks
                        like capturing criminals and bravely searching for lost treasures in uncharted territories.
                        Twelve-year-old Gon Freecss is determined to become the best Hunter possible in hopes of finding
                        his father, who was a Hunter himself and had long ago abandoned his young son. However, Gon soon
                        realizes the path to achieving his goals is far more challenging than he could have ever
                        imagined. Gon and his friends embark on an adventure that puts them through many hardships and
                        struggles. They will meet a plethora of monsters, creatures, and characters—all while learning
                        what being a Hunter truly means.

                        The appearance of "quirks," newly discovered super powers, has been steadily increasing over the
                        years, with 80 percent of humanity possessing various abilities from manipulation of elements to
                        shapeshifting. This leaves the remainder of the world completely powerless, and Izuku Midoriya
                        is one such individual.

                        Since he was a child, the ambitious middle schooler has wanted nothing more than to be a hero.
                        Izuku's unfair fate leaves him admiring heroes and taking notes on them whenever he can. But it
                        seems that his persistence has borne some fruit: Izuku meets the number one hero and his
                        personal idol, All Might. All Might's quirk is a unique ability that can be inherited, and he
                        has chosen Izuku to be his successor!

                        to enjoy a relatively peaceful and happy life. One day, Tanjirou decides to go down to the local
                        village to make a little money selling charcoal. On his way back, night falls, forcing Tanjirou
                        to take shelter in the house of a strange man, who warns him of the existence of flesh-eating
                        demons that lurk in the woods at night. Alongside the mysterious group calling themselves the
                        Demon Slayer Corps, Tanjirou will do whatever it takes to slay the demons and protect the
                        remnants of his beloved sister's humanity.

                        Centuries ago, mankind was slaughtered to near extinction by monstrous humanoid creatures called
                        titans, forcing humans to hide in fear behind enormous concentric walls. What makes these giants
                        truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears
                        to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within
                        defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter. However,
                        that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal titan manages to breach the supposedly
                        impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.

                        Japan, 1955: Mario Minakami has just arrived at Shounan Special Reform School along with five

                        cell, they meet older inmate Rokurouta Sakuragi—a former boxer—with whom they establish a close
                        bond. Under his guidance, and with the promise that they will meet again on the outside after
                        serving their sentences, the delinquents begin to view their hopeless situation in a better
                        light.Facing such hellish conditions, the seven inmates must scrape together all the strength
                        they have to survive until their sentences are up; but even if they do, just what kind of lives
                        are waiting for them on the other side?

                        is confident that the Fourth Holy Grail War will be different; namely, with a vessel of the Holy
                        Grail now in their grasp. Solely for this reason, the much hated "Magus Killer" Kiritsugu Emiya
                        is hired by the Einzberns, with marriage to their only daughter Irisviel as binding contract.

                        Kiritsugu now stands at the center of a cutthroat game of survival, facing off against six other
                        participants, each armed with an ancient familiar, and fueled by unique desires and ideals.
                        Accompanied by his own familiar, Saber, the notorious mercenary soon finds his greatest opponent
                        in Kirei Kotomine, a priest who seeks salvation from the emptiness within himself in pursuit of

                        "In order for something to be obtained, something of equal value must be lost."

                        Alchemy is bound by this Law of Equivalent Exchange—something the young brothers Edward and
                        Alphonse Elric only realize after attempting human transmutation: the one forbidden act of
                        alchemy. They pay a terrible price for their transgression—Edward loses his left leg, Alphonse
                        his physical body. It is only by the desperate sacrifice of Edward's right arm that he is able
                        to affix Alphonse's soul to a suit of armor. Devastated and alone, it is the hope that they
                        would both eventually return to their original bodies that gives Edward the inspiration to
                        obtain metal limbs called "automail" and become a state alchemist, the Fullmetal Alchemist.

                    <p class="synopsis-anime">
                        A shinigami, as a god of death, can kill any person—provided they see their victim's face and
                        write their victim's name in a notebook called a Death Note. One day, Ryuk, bored by the
                        shinigami lifestyle and interested in seeing how a human would use a Death Note, drops one into
                        the human realm.

                        High school student and prodigy Light Yagami stumbles upon the Death Note and—since he deplores
                        the state of the world—tests the deadly notebook by writing a criminal's name in it. When the
                        criminal dies immediately following his experiment with the Death Note, Light is greatly
                        surprised and quickly recognizes how devastating the power that has fallen into his hands could
                        be.
