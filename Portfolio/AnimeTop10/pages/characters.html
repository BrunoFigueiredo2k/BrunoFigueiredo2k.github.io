                        <p>Kaiman is the lead character of the manga. He appears to be the victim of a magic user, who
                            laid a curse on his head. It appears that despite having his head chopped off, he can
                            regenerate it in a matter of time.</p>

                    <p>Usopp is a liar and likes to play pranks on his crew members or just goof off with Luffy and
                        Chopper. He loves to tell tall tales to Chopper (who believes him blindly) or anyone who's
                        listening. The other aspect of Usopp besides his lying is his cowardice; he is a very timid
                        person, or so he thinks. In extremely stressful situations, Usopp has proven to be far more
                        courageous than he believes himself to be. He shows great resolve when his friends are
                        threatened or mocked by outsiders. Even though he is a complete coward in battle (except as his
                        alter ego, Sogeking), he is a useful part to the Straw Hat Pirates. <a

                    <h2>Shikamaru Nara - Naruto</h2>
                    <p>Shikamaru is an extremely unenthusiastic person, and as such lives his life avoiding work. This
                        is partly due to him seeking paths of least resistance, as he often chooses to do things he
                        would otherwise not do if people nag him enough. In his free time he typically takes naps,
                        watches clouds, and plays strategy games such as Shogi and Go. When put into a situation where
                        he potentially needs to put effort into something, he attempts to try to find a way to avoid it
                        such as forfeiting a battle or by pretending to be preoccupied with something else. In the
                        instances where he can not avoid these situations, Shikamaru tends to remark "how
                        troublesome." <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/2007/Shikamaru_Nara"

                        Sunshine, which made him renowned for gaining immense power during the day, and gradually
                        becoming weaker with the setting of the sun, leaving him frail and submissive at night. <a

                        and this has led to him winning many battles. Using Shu powered poker cards as his primary

                        Also, he is very intrigued by Gon and the potential this young boy has to become an adept and

                    <p>Zoro was the first crew member to be recruited by Luffy. Zoro is a skilled swordsman who fights
                        with his own unique sword style known as santoryu (three katana fighting style).This is achieved
                        by using one katana in each hand and another in his mouth. He is also seen fighting with only
                        one or two swords. When in a serious fight he ties his bandana, normally tied on the arm, on his
                        head.

                        Though not a samurai, he appears to maintain a certain degree of bushido, and is frequently
                        mistaken for one. Unlike Luffy and most of the other Straw Hat pirates, Zoro has been known to
                        kill his opponents if he has to, though never in cold blood. <a

                    <p>Roy Mustang is the "Flame Alchemist," having absolute control over heat and fire through alchemy.
                        Using special gloves that create a spark when he snaps his fingers, Roy can create anything from
                        a tiny ember to burn a letter, to a raging inferno that can destroy a humanoid body in seconds.
                        His precise control over the alchemically enhanced flame is so accurate that he can boil the
                        water in a persons' eyes and can also attack enemies amongst a riot without hurting any allies.
                        Outwardly arrogant and playfully manipulative, Mustang is intelligent and almost always one step
                        ahead of his opponents, and likes to feel in control of the situation.

                    <h2>Levi - Attack on Titan</h2>
                    <p>Levi is known as humanity's most powerful soldier. He's ranked as Captain of the Scouting Legion
                        division. Levi is also the leader of the Special Operations Squad, an elite team that he
                        hand-picked in order to protect Eren Yeager. While it is said that he is blunt and
                        unapproachable, it is noted that he has a strong respect for structure and discipline. There are
                        rumors that he was originally part of underground crime before he became a soldier. Although he
                        often appears to be unfriendly, he cares deeply for his team and has never undervalued human
                        life. He is also a notorious clean-freak. <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/45627/Levi"
